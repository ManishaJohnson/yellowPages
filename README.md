Django Framework application with Postgre DB to store phone directory information
Deployed on Vercel with backend Postgres, since inbuilt django-sqlite cannot be deployed in vercel. So used a more stable postgre tool
The Postgres server was taken from Railway app for deployment with an expiry. 

Note: If deployment is stopped, this is because of free trial from Railway. And Deployment was successful as shown in screenshot below.
